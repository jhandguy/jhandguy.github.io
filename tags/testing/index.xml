      <description>Most of the time, UI Testing gets abandoned because it becomes harder to maintain over time and one reason for that is: readability. We also tend to forget that UI tests should not only serve the purpose of verification but provide meaningful documentation that everybody (including non-developers) can understand. Alright, let’s get right into it, fellas!
What if we could write UI Tests in a human-readable language, that even a Product Owner could understand?</description>

      <title>UI Testing in iOS - Generating Accessibility Identifiers using Reflection</title>

      <description>One of the most annoying things about UI Testing in iOS is the need to assign Accessibility Identifiers to views that are hard to access otherwise. Could be that a view is deeply nested, or that it is not easily distinguishable from other views, lots of scenarios might lead to manually assign Accessibility Identifiers… But don’t you worry, friend, I got something for you!
What if we could generate and assign Accessibility Identifiers automatically, using reflection?</description>

      <title>Painless UI Testing in iOS (Part 3) - Disabling Animations</title>

      <description>Let’s be realistic, UI Testing is a pain. For everybody. And with everybody, I include both Android and iOS developers. The main reason for it is that we’ve all come to this point when one-tenth of the UI Tests fail, randomly, for no definite reason. Could be the CI Virtual Machine which was slower than usual, or a small latency in the emulator… Don’t get me started with execution time… We’ve all been through that.</description>
