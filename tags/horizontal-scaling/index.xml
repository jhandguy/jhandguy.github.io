      <description>The Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) is a fundamental feature of Kubernetes. It enables automatic scale-up and scale-down of containerized applications based on CPU usage, memory usage, or custom metrics.
Traditionally, when scaling software, we first think of vertical scaling: the CPU and the RAM are increased so the application consuming them can perform better. While this seems like a flawless mechanism on paper, it actually comes with many drawbacks.
First, upgrading the CPU or RAM on a physical machine (or VM) requires downtime and unless a Pod Disruption Budget (PDB) is used to handle disruptions, all pods will be evicted and recreated in the new resized node.</description>
