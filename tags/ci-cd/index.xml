      <description>For many companies, testing and releasing are still very blurry processes, which donâ€™t seem to work as they should. Testing is mostly manual, slow and error-prone. Releasing is usually also manual and slow, making its frequency hard to maintain on a sprint-basis. Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) are all about automating both testing and releasing, making it possible for a team to release every week or two. At EGYM, we have achieved just that and I am going to tell you all about it!</description>
