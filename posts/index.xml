      <description>For many companies, testing and releasing are still very blurry processes, which don’t seem to work as they should. Testing is mostly manual, slow and error-prone. Releasing is usually also manual and slow, making its frequency hard to maintain on a sprint-basis. Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) are all about automating both testing and releasing, making it possible for a team to release every week or two. At EGYM, we have achieved just that and I am going to tell you all about it!</description>

      <title>UI Testing in iOS - Robot Pattern</title>

      <description>Most of the time, UI Testing gets abandoned because it becomes harder to maintain over time and one reason for that is: readability. We also tend to forget that UI tests should not only serve the purpose of verification but provide meaningful documentation that everybody (including non-developers) can understand. Alright, let’s get right into it, fellas!
 What if we could write UI Tests in a human-readable language, that even a Product Owner could understand?</description>

      <title>UI Testing in iOS - Generating Accessibility Identifiers using Reflection</title>
      <link>https://jhandguy.github.io/posts/generating-accessibility-identifiers-ios/</link>

      <description>One of the most annoying things about UI Testing in iOS is the need to assign Accessibility Identifiers to views that are hard to access otherwise. Could be that a view is deeply nested, or that it is not easily distinguishable from other views, lots of scenarios might lead to manually assign Accessibility Identifiers… But don’t you worry, friend, I got something for you!
 What if we could generate and assign Accessibility Identifiers automatically, using reflection?</description>

      <title>Painless UI Testing in iOS (Part 3) - Disabling Animations</title>

      <description>Let’s be realistic, UI Testing is a pain. For everybody. And with everybody, I include both Android and iOS developers. The main reason for it is that we’ve all come to this point when one-tenth of the UI Tests fail, randomly, for no definite reason. Could be the CI Virtual Machine which was slower than usual, or a small latency in the emulator… Don’t get me started with execution time… We’ve all been through that.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Design Patterns in iOS (Part 4) - Factory</title>
      <link>https://jhandguy.github.io/posts/factory-design-pattern-ios/</link>

      <description>Design Patterns are part of Mobile Development for a while now and a revolution towards Quality Assurance is on. Such patterns have become a standard among the community, yet implementing an academic one might come with a price — complexity.
Because some Design Patterns solve very complex problems, they often result in a complicated implementation as well. So complex sometimes, that we tend to use heavy Third Party Frameworks, even for simple use cases.</description>
